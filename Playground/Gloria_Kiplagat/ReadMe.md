# Analyzing and Forecasting Real Estate Market Trends in Melbourne

## **Objective**
This project leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze real estate market trends in the City of Melbourne. The goal is to forecast future developments, identify investment hotspots, and uncover key factors influencing property prices. The insights aim to support stakeholders such as policymakers, investors, and developers.

## **Key Features**
1. **Market Analysis**
   - Study historical trends in real estate activity, including building developments and construction types.
   - Compare different regions within Melbourne to identify patterns in growth and development.

2. **Hotspot Identification**
   - Use geospatial analysis to detect clusters of high-growth areas or zones with rapid development activities.
   - Highlight suburbs with rising popularity based on development metrics.

3. **Price Forecasting**
   - Predict future property prices using time series forecasting models and machine learning algorithms.
   - Incorporate factors such as development activity, building footprints, and location data into predictions.

4. **Decision Support Insights**
   - Provide data-driven recommendations for urban planning, resource allocation, and investment strategy formulation.

## **Proposed Workflow**
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Collect and preprocess datasets:
     - [2020 Building Footprints](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/2020-building-footprints/information/)
     - [Development Activity Monitor](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/development-activity-monitor/information/?disjunctive.status&disjunctive.clue_small_area&disjunctive.clue_block)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize spatial distribution of developments using geospatial tools.
   - Analyze temporal trends in development activities and correlate them with socio-economic factors.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create features like proximity to amenities, density of development, and historical growth rates.
   - Encode categorical data like zoning classifications or development status.

4. **Model Development**
   - Apply time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict development metrics.
   - Use regression and ensemble machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for property price predictions.
   - Experiment with neural networks for complex patterns in geospatial and temporal data.

5. **Validation and Tuning**
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE for forecasting and R² for regression.
   - Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

6. **Result Interpretation**
   - Generate heatmaps and prediction dashboards to display key insights.
   - Summarize factors impacting real estate trends and forecast reliability.
